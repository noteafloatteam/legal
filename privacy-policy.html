<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Effective date:</strong> December 27, 2025</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>NoteAfloat</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “the App”)
handles information when you use the NoteAfloat Android application.
</p>

<p>
By installing or using the App, you acknowledge and agree to the practices described
in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. App Information</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>App name:</strong> NoteAfloat</li>
    <li><strong>Developer:</strong> Md Abdul Ahad Khan <!--(sole proprietor)--></li>
    <li><strong>Contact email:</strong> noteafloatteam@gmail.com</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>2.1 Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
<p>
We do not collect, store, or transmit personal information such as names, email
addresses, phone numbers, contact lists, device identifiers, IP addresses,
location data, or account credentials.
</p>

<h3>2.2 User-Created Content (Notes)</h3>
<p>
The App allows users to create notes and related content. All notes and related
data are stored <strong>locally on the user’s device only</strong>.
We do not collect, upload, sync, or store user notes on any server.
</p>

<h3>2.3 Device Permissions</h3>
<p>
The App currently requests access to <strong>Notifications</strong> only, in order to
deliver reminders and alerts created by the user.
</p>
<p>
If additional permissions (such as camera or microphone) are introduced in the
future, their purpose and usage will be clearly disclosed and this Privacy Policy
will be updated accordingly.
</p>

<h3>2.4 Payments and Subscriptions</h3>
<p>
The App may offer paid subscriptions or in-app purchases. All payments are processed
exclusively through <strong>Google Play Billing</strong>.
</p>
<p>
We do not collect or process payment card information. Payment details are handled
directly by Google in accordance with Google’s own privacy and security policies.
</p>

<h3>2.5 Voluntary Communications</h3>
<p>
If you contact us via email for support or feedback, you may voluntarily provide
information such as your email address or message content. This information is used
solely to respond to your inquiry.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>

<p>
Any information handled by the App is used only for the following purposes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Providing core note-taking functionality</li>
    <li>Displaying notifications and reminders requested by the user</li>
    <li>Enabling paid features through Google Play subscriptions</li>
    <li>Responding to user support requests</li>
</ul>

<p>
We do not sell, rent, or share personal information with third parties.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>
At this time, the App does <strong>not</strong> use third-party analytics services,
advertising networks, cloud storage providers, or external SDKs.
</p>

<p>
Google Play Billing is used solely for payment processing. Use of paid features is
also subject to Google’s terms and privacy policies.
</p>

<p>
If third-party services are added in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated
to reflect those changes.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>5. Data Storage and Deletion</h2>

<p>
User-created notes remain on the user’s device until they are deleted by the user
or the App is uninstalled.
</p>

<p>
Users may delete notes using in-app features or by clearing the App’s data through
Android system settings. Uninstalling the App removes locally stored data from the
device.
</p>

<p>
We cannot delete data that exists only on a user’s device without access to that
device.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>
NoteAfloat is <strong>not directed to children under the age of 13</strong>.
</p>

<p>
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. 
<!-- If a parent -->
<!-- or guardian believes that a child has provided personal information to us, they may
contact us and we will take reasonable steps to delete such information. -->
</p>

<p>
The App is intended for general use. Parents and guardians are responsible for
supervising children’s use of the App and the device.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>7. User Rights</h2>

<p>
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights related to personal data,
including access, correction, deletion, or restriction of processing.
</p>

<p>
Because the App stores data locally and collects minimal information, most user
control can be exercised directly on the device. For developer-held data (such as
support emails), requests may be sent to our contact email.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>8. Security</h2>

<p>
We use reasonable measures to protect any information we directly control.
However, the security of locally stored notes also depends on the security of
the user’s device.
</p>

<p>
Users are encouraged to enable device locks, encryption, and backups according to
their preferences.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>9. International Use and Governing Law</h2>

<p>
The App is available to users worldwide. This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws
of Bangladesh, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
</p>

<p>
Users in other jurisdictions may have additional rights under applicable local laws.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are made, the
“Effective date” at the top of this page will be updated.
</p>

<p>
Continued use of the App after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of
the revised Privacy Policy.
</p>
